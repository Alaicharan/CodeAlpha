Functional Requirements
User Input/Output

The chatbot should greet the user when the program starts.

It must accept user input and provide appropriate responses via the console.

The conversation loop continues until the user types a specific exit keyword (e.g., "bye").

Response Handling

Use if-elif statements to match simple user inputs (e.g., greetings, asking for help).

Provide predefined responses for:

Greetings (e.g., "hello", "hi")

Farewells (e.g., "bye")

Asking for the chatbot's name

Unrecognized input (default response)

Functions

Implement at least two Python functions:

One function to handle user input and return a response.

One function to start and manage the main chat loop.

Loops

Use a loop (such as while) to maintain the chat session until the user chooses to exit.

Technical Requirements
Python Version

Use Python 3.x.

Code Structure

Organize code with clear function definitions.

Use comments to explain sections of the code.

Error Handling

Handle empty inputs gracefully (e.g., prompt the user again).

Ensure the program does not crash on unexpected inputs.

Getting Started
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Use any code editor to write your Python code.

Run the script from the terminal with: python chatbot.py
