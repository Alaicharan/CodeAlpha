HangmanGame:

This code uses basic Python features and keeps things simple:

A small predefined word list

6 wrong guess limit

Basic input/output

Uses random, while, if-else, strings, and lists 

chatbot:

How this works:
The chat() function runs an infinite loop, asking the user for input.

The user's input is passed to get_response() which uses if-elif to decide what to reply.

The chat ends when the user types "bye" (case insensitive).

If the user enters an empty input, the bot prompts them to say something.

You can run this script directly in Python 3
